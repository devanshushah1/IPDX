The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

Our method of working towards reducing the number of puppy mills is via adoption, direct action and education.

Gaonkar",Social service,"India has not developed technologically to provide quality living to its vast masses, even after 60 years of its independence. The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

There was thus a need for an organisation with wider perspective, involving various specialists and workers. The CSSC is a centre of study, research and action with a difference"

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

These young adults have finished training at SPJ Sadhana school for the autistic impairment in simple job skills, such as, to name a few, sticking, plastering, moulding, pasting, pressing and folding. Here at Shraddha, they are given workshop training in making ecofriendly items, such as different types of gift bags from recycled paper, patraval items ? plates and bowls, agarbati stands, trendy jewellery beaded on safety pins, rangolis, colourful lantern bags, hand painted envelopes, Zen garden. Our specialty is the ecofriendly leaf plate which is quite a hit with our clients. We have developed a flexible method that involves intense training which is not easy to begin with. These young minds have their own sense of the environment which is different from the ones we operate in. Our staff work with them on a one to one basis.

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

Gaonkar",Social service,"India has not developed technologically to provide quality living to its vast masses, even after 60 years of its independence. The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

In particular, animal mills, where the female species are bred over and over until death to produce babies for monetary gain. Please look up ‘puppy mills’ on google and see exactly what happens in these horrid sites. 99 percent of the commercial breeders in this country are full fledged puppy mills. Our method of working towards reducing the number of puppy mills is via adoption, direct action and education. We want to gently alter indian mindset towards animals and hope to make our country a safe place for them one day. As Mahatma Gandhi once very rightly quoted the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated"

Gaonkar",Social service,"India has not developed technologically to provide quality living to its vast masses, even after 60 years of its independence. The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

Gaonkar",Social service,"India has not developed technologically to provide quality living to its vast masses, even after 60 years of its independence. The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

Shraddha was started in 1997 with a singular mission, of making autistic people self-confident through their own creative ability. These young adults have finished training at SPJ Sadhana school for the autistic impairment in simple job skills, such as, to name a few, sticking, plastering, moulding, pasting, pressing and folding. Here at Shraddha, they are given workshop training in making ecofriendly items, such as different types of gift bags from recycled paper, patraval items ? plates and bowls, agarbati stands, trendy jewellery beaded on safety pins, rangolis, colourful lantern bags, hand painted envelopes, Zen garden. Our specialty is the ecofriendly leaf plate which is quite a hit with our clients. We have developed a flexible method that involves intense training which is not easy to begin with. These young minds have their own sense of the environment which is different from the ones we operate in. Our staff work with them on a one to one basis. With continuous practice they gradually get adjusted to the training and become alive with enthusiasm. They are then eager to be promoted to group working. The aim is to slowly help them blossom into their own and connecting with them at their level"

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

In particular, animal mills, where the female species are bred over and over until death to produce babies for monetary gain. Please look up ‘puppy mills’ on google and see exactly what happens in these horrid sites. 99 percent of the commercial breeders in this country are full fledged puppy mills. Our method of working towards reducing the number of puppy mills is via adoption, direct action and education. We want to gently alter indian mindset towards animals and hope to make our country a safe place for them one day.

Gaonkar",Social service,"India has not developed technologically to provide quality living to its vast masses, even after 60 years of its independence. The great need is felt to raise the quality of Indian life by modernization and higher education. Therefore, this Forum aims to collect funds from various sources and encourage research and, if necessary, to promote research by foreign collaboration. Today we feel to undertake research in every walk of life- healthcare, defense, technical education, natural disaster, infrastructure, construction, etc., and so the requirement of enough funds needs no explanation. Compared with Western countries, we spend much less on research. Obviously, this Forum intends to ameliorate this situation by generating enough funds, Due to rampant corruption, authoritarianism and delay in Justice delivery, human rights are the first causality in Indian democracy. Those who are meant to protect human rights are actually the violators of human rights. Moreover, in a populous and poor country like Indian, it is not possible to provide police protection to all people. Therefore, this Forum lays stress on legal literacy and self-defense. When people are conscious of their human rights as well as the limitation of various state authorities, they are free from state negligence and oppression in the name of welfare. Environmental hazards are enveloping the whole world what to say about India. The problem of global warming has given us the wake-up call. We need to make our urbanization and industrialization eco-friendly; otherwise we will face shortage of drinking water, submergence of many cities on or near seashores and face insurmountable problems. This Forum is conscious establishing harmony between Man and Nature and so takes interest in educating people on doing environment-friendly activities. Although there has been rapid rise in female education and employment still much remains to be done. This Forum stresses on the equality of women in all walks of life and so takes interest in searching various opportunities for women development. Lack of education is the chief reason of backwardness and the poor families remain backward because they encourage their children to earn, not to learn. Therefore, this Forum pays greater attention to the education of children of those families who are below the poverty line. In the field of health care, project is on anvil to provide medical treatment to those who reside in the remote villages and also arrange the first-aid training to the selected persons. It is well known that there is a great divide between rural and urban areas in India. The rural areas badly need electricity, roads, telephones, hospitals, schools and colleges not only for the rural people but also for lessening the population pressure in big cities. We believe that this divide can be bridged by adopting what is called the PURA principle. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, and so this Forum is also engaged in educating people on the PURA Principle. Beggary has become a big industry in India. This Forum has, therefore, also undertaken the prevention of beggary and drug addiction"

Please look up ‘puppy mills’ on google and see exactly what happens in these horrid sites. 99 percent of the commercial breeders in this country are full fledged puppy mills. Our method of working towards reducing the number of puppy mills is via adoption, direct action and education. We want to gently alter indian mindset towards animals and hope to make our country a safe place for them one day. As Mahatma Gandhi once very rightly quoted the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated"
